This C project was developed for a university subject. The main goals was to work with threads and sockets. The guidelines of this project can be found in the pdf files “FSO1314-L05” and “FSO1314-L06.pdf”.

NOTE: In order to be well implemented, a mutex is missing in the server code to guarantee that there’re not two threads at the same time, one consulting the status the other putting or consuming values, using the buffer.
